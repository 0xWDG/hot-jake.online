"[Hot-jake.online](https://Hot-jake.online)" (backup: [Github Pages](0xwdg.github.io/hot-jake.online/)) is a website built for fun.
When we where at [Cafe Bax](https://www.cafebax.nl) for one of our weekly [Meeten and Drinken](https://appsterdam.rs/events/meeten-en-drinken/) events, we came up with the idea to ✨ Promote ✨ Jake's hotness.  
And then this website has been born.

Other silly domainnames/services which i set up (in the past) include: [DateADeveloper.com](https://dateadeveloper.com), [quacky.nl](https://quacky.nl), and [The-App-Team.com](https://the-app-team.com).
